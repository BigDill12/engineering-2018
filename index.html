</p><h3>Family</h3>
  <p>I am one of five family members, Mom, Dad and two brothers.I have one older brother who is three years older then me and goes to college at youngstown state. I have a little brother who is three years younger than me and is a freshamn at mayfield high school 
  </p><h4>Sports</h4>
  <p>I play Basketball for mayfield and this is my first year playing. Last year they went 2-20 so I had to come out to help my squad. I am a Fan of all Cleveland teams meaning the Browns, Indians and the Cavs. But if I had to root for a team that wasn't from cleveland it would have to be the Arizona Cardinals
